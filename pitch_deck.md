# Verana: the missing trust layer of the Internet

## Problem

2024: The internet lacks a trust layer

- existing communication channels are insecure and obsolete.
- big techs platforms doesn't provide a sure-fire way of verifying the identity of users, service providers and/or content publishers.
- moderation is not efficient (facebook) or sometimes not possible (telegram).
- total fraud and identity theft cases have nearly tripled over the last decade: the global cost of cybercrime is estimated to reach an annual $10.5 trillion by 2025 according to CyberSecurity Ventures.

## Solution

An Identity layer for the Internet

- Identification of service providers;
- trustable, persistent and bidirectional communication channels;
- no public identifier, so user cannot be spammed
- easy to integrate modules

Decentralized trust services for data sovereignty

- Users and businesses can deploy their social channel, chatbot, meeting room, office software... in any datacenter
- Register their service in a decentralized service directory;
- Enable their service in ecosystem Apps: social network Apps, messaging apps,...
- Connection to services are peer-to-peer, so Apps have no access to service data
- Service and content moderation is performed by service owners and their users

###

Today

- we use centralized proprietary big tech platforms that are abusing our data
- there is no way of verifying the identity of users, service providers and/or content publishers.
- everything is based on vendor lock-in, nothing is interoperable
